# Basic-C-Sharp
These are some projects I created using C#, Visual Studio, and the .NET Framework.

## Projects:

- [Car Insurance App](https://github.com/ericlemiere/Basic-C-Sharp/tree/main/CarInsurance)
- [BlackJack Game](https://github.com/ericlemiere/Basic-C-Sharp/tree/main/TwentyOne)
- [Newsletter Signup](https://github.com/ericlemiere/Basic-C-Sharp/tree/main/NewsletterAppMVC)


### Car Insurance App:
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. The site takes in user input and, using business logic, calculates an insurance quote based on age, car driven, tickets, and more. There is also an admin page that displays all the quotes generated.

### BlackJack Game:
This is a simple BlackJack card game that the user can play in the console window. Although the user experience is simple and rudimentary, the program itself uses different classes to construct different aspects of the game, uses inheritance, and throws exceptions when user input is incorrect. This game also logs those exceptions to a text file.

### Newsletter Signup:
This is another simple MVC web application that allows a user to sign up for a newsletter. An admin page allows the admin to see all the signups, and can unsubscripe individuals from the list.
